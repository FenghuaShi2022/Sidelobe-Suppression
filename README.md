1. double_line_light_sheet.m
2. four_line_light_sheet.m
3. Bessel_light_sheet.m

 With each code file, one can produce the following outputs:

(1) focal electric field of the xz and yz planes (second and fourth columns' subgraphs in figure 2, 5 and 7 in the manuscript)

(2) z-profile of dithered light sheet (third columns' subgraphs in figures 2, 5 and 7 in the manuscript; figures 4, 6 and 8 in the manuscript)

(3) propagation length (FHWM of the y-profile of the light sheet), illumination variation, light sheet thickness (FHWM of the z-profile of the light sheet), and P_side/P_main (figure 3, figure S1, and figure S2-S5)

(4) P_1st_side (figure S2-S5)

(5) z-profile of the dithered light sheet obtained by using Fourier transform (for the comparison with the z-profile obtained by using diffraction integration method )

**** relative_P_1st_side_four_line.mat and relative_P_1st_side_Bessel_line.mat are the data required for the calculation of P_1st_side in four line and Bessel light sheet, respectively.******
